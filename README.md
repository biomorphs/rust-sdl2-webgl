# rust-sdl2-webgl

Messing about with rust on desktop + wasm 

- using glow for opengl context 
- uses SDL2 for desktop window + gl context creation
- uses websys + canvas + webgl 2 for wasm 

To do 
- continue to make more modular
- add nalgebra or nalgebra-glm and start adding basic functionality
    - define a 3d camera 
    - pass matrices to shaders
- build some geometry for drawing
    - basic cube/sphere/triangle instances
